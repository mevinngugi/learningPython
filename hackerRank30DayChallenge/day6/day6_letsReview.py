""" Task
Given a string, S, of length N that is indexed from 0 to N-1,
print its even-indexed and odd-indexed characters as 2 space-separated strings on a single line
(see the Sample below for more detail).

Note: 0 is considered to be an even index.

Example:
s = adbecf 

Print: abc def

Constraints
1<= T <= 10
2<= length of S <= 10000

Sample Input
2
Hacker
Rank

Sample Output
